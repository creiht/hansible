# NOTE(sigmavirus24): Explanation of the regular expression:
# - The Date is formatted by oslo.log as YYYY-MM-DD
# - The Time is formatted by oslo.log as HH:MM:SS.Microseconds
# - The Python Module tends to look like "cinder.api.scheduler"
# - The Id is the group of request Ids, e.g., [req-<UUID4> ...]
# We don't want lines like these to be captures as "multiline"
# (hence the negate: true line) so we match the lines that we want
# to be single log line items and negate them. We want to exclude
# "Traceback" here because:
# 1. It's not useful - it has the same timestamp as the actual
#    traceback.
# 2. If there is a multiline log before it, you would get one large
#    log item instead of two discrete items.
