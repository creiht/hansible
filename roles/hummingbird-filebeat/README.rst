Filebeat
========

Set-up filebeat for light-weight log shipping.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

.. code-block:: yaml

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: "filebeat" }
